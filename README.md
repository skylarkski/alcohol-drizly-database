# An Alcohol Dataset - Find what suits you!
*Note, this dataset is currently primarely Beers, although in the future I have plans to expand the alcohol selection with Wine and Liquor*

An alcohol dataset created by scraping <a href="https://drizly.com/">Drizly</a>, an alcohol retail and delivery company.

With the use of BeautifulSoup4 and Cloudscraper, I was able to gather enough data to create a model

# The 5 Ws
<ol>
	<li><strong>Why</strong> - Many alcohol datasets already exist, and they range from pop media Top 10 lists to expansive datasets on Breweries and Brands. Most projects lack the most essential atribute according to the youngest legal beer enthusiast demographic, <b>Price</b>. As with any product we enjoy, knowing the price of an item can factor greatly into the decisions made when purchasing alcohol.</li>
	<li><strong>What</strong> – I chose Drizly to gather data, because as well as having an astoudingly vast selection of beer, every item has a price. Some of the data gathered from Drizly lacked some metrics and atributes desirable for a dataset of this type, like most notably thorough ratings. With that being said, I still found it perfect for the use of this project, as the dataset created from Drizly's inventory provided an insight on what is commerically available nationwide, rather than making an expansive dataset of products excellent yet unobtainable. I believe that the merge of data of a mainstream service such as Drizly and an indie style alcohol critique forum such as <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a> or <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/">BeerAdvocate</a> is a match made in heaven.</li>
	<li><strong>Who</strong> – </li>
	<li><strong>When</strong> – sometimes this question gets asked before all the question we discussed above get answered. You need to know why, what and who will be part of your project before you can adequately answer when it will get completed.</li>
	<li><strong>Where</strong> – then after all is said and done, where will your project be done? Where will it be delivered? With today's global and dispersed environments, this question is not as simple as it may seem!</li>
</ol>
